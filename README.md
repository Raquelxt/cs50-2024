# CS50x 2024 Course Repository

Welcome to my repository for CS50x 2024! This repository serves as the main directory for organizing all the weekly assignments and projects completed throughout the course. Each week will have its own folder containing relevant files and documentation.

## About CS50

CS50, officially known as "CS50: Introduction to Computer Science," is Harvard University's entry-level course that introduces students to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. Taught by David J. Malan, CS50 is designed for both majors and non-majors, regardless of prior programming experience. The course covers foundational concepts such as algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, and software engineering. Students learn to program in several languages, including C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript, alongside web development skills. 

Through a series of engaging problem sets inspired by real-world scenarios, students develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills essential for computer science.
