# Week 1: C Programming

This week, we focused on the basics of C programming. The following problems were solved:

1. **Hello, Itâ€™s Me**: A program that prompts the user for their name and prints a greeting.
2. **Mario**: A program that creates a pyramid of hashes based on user input for height.
3. **Credit**: A program that validates credit card numbers using Luhn's Algorithm.

## Problem Set Solutions

- **Hello, Itâ€™s Me**
